		<h2>Featured Artist - Chixdiggit celebrate 20 years as a band this year!</h2>
		
			<p> Chicago’s Rise Against are the most rockin’ thing to come outta the Midwest since the war. 
			Featuring former members of the late great 88 Fingers Louie, these guys have the punk rock 
			resume to back it up. This four-piece punk unit plays a punchy brand of melodic hardcore heavily 
			influenced by bands like Bad Religion, Minor Threat, and Bad Brains. Talk about credentials!
			Their debut full length, The Unraveling, is a 16-song hardcore blast that’ll rattle your skull. 
			Not only that, but these nutty Midwesterners have toured their straght edge arses off. Since the release 
			of their first record, they’ve went out with AFI, Sick Of It All, NOFX, Snapcase…the list goes on!</p>
			<p>The latest full length from Rise Against speaks for itself, as Revolutions Per Minute is one of the most 
			celebrated releases in Fat history. RPM combines punk and hardcore with trace elements of emo for an altogether 
			rockin’ experience. Rise Against will be doing a fistful of touring in support of their new record: North 
			American Fat Tour, European Fat Tour, Japanese Fat Tour, Warped Tour…you get the idea.</p>
