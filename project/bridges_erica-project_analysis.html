			<h1>Fat Wreck Chords | Project Analysis</h1>

					<ul> 
						<li>Project: Re-Design</li> 
						<li>Web Designer: Erica Bridges</li> 
					</ul>


			<h2>Site Intent</h2>

					<p> The primary focus of this re-deign is to eliminate visual confusion and make the site more user friendly and aesthetically
					pleasing. As it stands, the site applies harsh color combinations and clutter. It is very difficult to identify the logo as it 
					clashes with the picture background of a band member.</p>
					
					<p>Site re-design will be accomplished by applying a navigation that runs across the top of the page, as opposed to the current site 
					that applies a break between each link. Also, by combining the media content (ie. Videos, Records, MP3s & Pics) into one drop 
					down menu, it will make for a more organized navigation. The re-design would also need to incorporate responsive design.</p>
					
			<h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
			
					<p>Based on the research that was preformed, the site <em>Fat Wreck Chords</em>, has very few visitors. <em>Fat Wreck Chords</em> is an 
					independent record label for punk bands. According to Alexa.com, <em>Fat Wreck Chords</em>is ranked at 333,417. The site itself has been 
					online for fourteen years and has a relatively good traffic rank. The target audience for this site is mostly males from the age of 25-34 yrs.,
					have no children, received some college education and view the site mostly from home. Within the last month, the traffic amount has decreased by 29%. 
					and user only stay on the site on average for about two minutes spending 30 seconds on each page. This is possibley due to the design of the site itself.
					The site needs to maintain the target audience, however, create more white space and eye trails to keep the user interested. Below are some of the competitors for the website: </p>

	 		<h2> Targeted Audience </h2>
	 		
	 			<h3>The Line Jumpers</h3>
	 				<p>Band of five young guys. The lead singer works for a record store in the Bay Area and has heard about Fat Wreck Chords. The band has been 
	 				working on their songs and has finally been able to create a demo to send to the record company to hopefully get signed. The band, collectively
	 				has looked into other labels, yet has not made a decision yet. The want a record label that allows the band to stay creative and push the envelope.
	 				The band has come up with a lot of questions and want to make sure that the record label is easy to get in contact with or least have FAQ's that can help. 
	 				The Line Jumpers are also concerned about wether or not the marketing of the record label is done well.</p>		
	 			
	 			<h3>Velvet Lizards</h3>
	 				<p>Band of three guys out of New York. Have already signed with the label and visit the site often to make sure their record and the bands merchandise is being 
	 				marketing well to the public. The Lizards also have a gig coming up and have concerns about the advertisement of the concert and make sure the venues directions are listed.</p>
