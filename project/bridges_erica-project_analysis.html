			<h1>Fat Wreck Chords | Project Analysis</h1>

					<ul> 
						<li>Project: Re-Design</li> 
						<li>Web Designer: Erica Bridges</li> 
					</ul>


			<h2>Site Intent</h2>

					<p> The primary focus of this re-deign is to eliminate visual confusion and make the site more user friendly and aesthetically
					pleasing. As it stands, the site applies harsh color combinations and clutter. It is very difficult to identify the logo as it 
					clashes with the picture background of a band member. We also need to get this site on the list! Currently, the website and has barely
					had any viewers in the last 3 months.</p>
					
					<p>Site re-design will be accomplished by applying a navigation that runs across the top of the page, as opposed to the current site 
					that applies a break between each link. Also, by combining the media content (ie. Videos, Records, MP3s & Pics) into one drop 
					down menu, it will make for a more organized navigation.</p>
					
			<h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
			
					<p>Based on the research that was preformed, the site <em>Fat Wreck Chords</em>, has very few visitors. <em>Fat Wreck Chords</em> is an 
					independent record label for punk bands. According to Alexa.com, <em>Fat Wreck Chords</em>is ranked at 8,446,309. The site itself has been online for fourteen years and in the 
					last 3 months, has not had any viewers. The target audience for this site includes males and females, from the age of 18-34 yrs. </p>
